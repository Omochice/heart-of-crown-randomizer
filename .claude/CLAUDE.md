# AI-DLC and Spec-Driven Development

Kiro-style Spec Driven Development implementation on AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle)

## Project Context

### Paths
- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`
- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`

### Steering vs Specification

**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context
**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features

### Active Specifications
- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications
- Use `/kiro:spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress

## Development Guidelines
- User interaction language MUST match the user's input language
- Code and code comments MUST be written in English
- All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language)

## Minimal Workflow
- Phase 0 (optional): `/kiro:steering`, `/kiro:steering-custom`
- Phase 1 (Specification):
  - `/kiro:spec-init "description"`
  - `/kiro:spec-requirements {feature}`
  - `/kiro:validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)
  - `/kiro:spec-design {feature} [-y]`
  - `/kiro:validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)
  - `/kiro:spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`
- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/kiro:spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`
  - `/kiro:validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)
- Progress check: `/kiro:spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)

## Development Rules
- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track
- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/kiro:spec-status`
- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.

## TDD Process
- Each task MUST follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  - **Red**: Write a failing test first
  - **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
  - **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
- Each step (Red, Green, Refactor) MUST have its own commit
- All commits MUST follow conventional commit format
- Commit type MUST be decided based on how users (randomizer users) are affected by the change
- Specification updates MUST use `chore(spec):` prefix

## Code Documentation
- Code comments SHOULD explain WHY NOT an alternative approach was chosen, rather than WHAT or HOW
- Test code SHOULD clearly describe WHAT is being tested
- Commit body MUST include:
  - WHY the change was made
  - How to verify the change (verification method)

## Steering Configuration
- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory
- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Custom files are supported (managed via `/kiro:steering-custom`)
